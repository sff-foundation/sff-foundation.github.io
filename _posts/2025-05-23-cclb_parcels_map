The Cook County Landbank (CCLB) has reached out to The Steans Family Foundation (SFF) with a list of North Lawndale properties in their inventory, offering SFF an opportunity to kake a bulk acquisition of vacant land for development purposes.

To guide the selection of which properties would make sense to aqcuire, I have mapped the parcel locations of all available CCLB properties and plotted it alongside available Cook County and City of Chicago owned vacant lots, as well as privately-owned vacant lots to see if we can combine those properties with the higher priority properties to have a block-by-block strategy where we may be able to find four blocks together where we would potentially start and then expand from there.  

To this end, I have provided an interactive map below for you to use to explore possibilities and come to your own conclusions.

# CCLB Parcels for Acquisition Map

The above map was created for the purpose of identifying all contiguous vacant parcels (city owned, county owned,privately owned, and CCLB properites) in North Lawndale that could potentially be bundled and acquired to host potential development projects.

This map has four layers, each layer containing the individual parcels currently owned by either the City of Chicago, Cook County, Privately Owned, or Available CCLB Properties for Sale.

The CCLB properties in question are labeled as the "Available CCLB Properties" layer and are colored red for quick identification.
