## Fatal & Non-Fatal Shootings from 1991-2024
<p>
<b>Purpose</b>
To analyze violence spikes and reductions in North Lawndale from 1990 – 2025 in order to identify periods of shooting declines and increases and compare them to documented Community Violence Intervention activity in the neighborhood. Furthermore, we hope this historical analysis of shooting victimizations, both Fatal & Non-Fatal can help us contextualize the most recent surge in North Lawndale shootings since 2020 to get a different perspective on the impact of the North Lawndale Collaborative’s CVI efforts. 
</p>
<b>Unit of Analysis: Fatal & Non-Fatal Shootings</b>
<p>
Data on shootings in North Lawndale comes from the “Violence Reduction  - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings” dataset on City of Chicago’s Open Data Portal. The records in this dataset cover the years 1991 through 2025; however, while data on “Fatal Shootings” is available from 1991-2025, data on “Non-Fatal Shootings” is only available from 2010 to the Present.
</p>
<b>Periodization of Shooting Victimizations</b>
<p>
To make the most of the longitudinal nature of this shooting data, we first looked at only “Fatal Shootings” from 1991 to 2024 (excluding 2025 because we are only two months into the year) in order to identify and chart different eras or periods of Shootings & Violence Intervention over the past 33 years. 
The following periods were identified and defined based on trends of historic decreases or surges in the absolute number of Fatal Shootings occurring in the North Lawndale Community Area.  
  <ol>
    <li>Decades of Decline (1991-2007)</li>
    <li>Stabilization (2007-2014)</li>
    <li>Surge (2014-2019)</li>
    <li>COVID-19 (2021-2024)</li>
  </ol>

# Vacant Parcels Map

<iframe src="/assets/maps/parcel_universe_cluster_map.html" height="700" width="1000"></iframe>

This map can be used to identify clustered vacant parcels regardless of ownership type, generate a measure of square acreage of each clustered parcel group, and allow users to see which parcels comprise each cluster and identify ownership.

For example, say that the Chicago Cubs want to develop a community center and baseball fields in North Lawndale, a site which would require 12-14 acres of contiguous land. If confined to city-owned lots, whose inventory comes from ChiBlockBuilder, there are no contiguous parcels measuring more than 2 acres. By bringing in county owned parcels and privately owned vacant parcels, we can identify portfolios of parcels across ownership type that could be strategically acquired to make such a development possible.

While none of the clustered parcels have an acerage matching the 12 to 14 acres desired, clusters have been found up top 7 acres, where multiple clusters are next to each other. 

Two map Layers:
- City-owned Parcels
  - Underlying Parcels from ChiBlock Builder, Cook County Land Bank, Cook County Assessor with underlying Address,ownership type, and other information.
- Merged Parcels
  - Layer of above individual parcels merged if they were touching. Provides area in acres of merged parcels to help identify large groupings of publicly owned city parcels for development.
