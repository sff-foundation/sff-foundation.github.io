Chicago has a total of 522,571 Service Lines in its Public Water System (PWS). As part of a <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/lead-pipes-are-widespread-and-used-every-state">national survey</a> conducted to determine federal allocation to states for lead mitigation and remediation, the EPA found that 387,095 of Chicago’s Service Lines are estimated to contain any lead pipe with 42 having been previously downstream from a lead source and containing galvanized pipes, meaning 74% of Chicago’s homes are estimated to contain lead service lines.
In absolute terms, Chicago has more lead service lines than any other City in the nation.

Chicago (387,000), Cleveland (235,000), New York City (112,000), Detroit (80,000), Milwaukee (74,000), Denver (64,000), St. Louis (63,000), Indianapolis (55,000), Minneapolis (49,000), Buffalo, New York (40,000).  

A 2022 analysis of The City of Chicago’s Lead Water Testing program data by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/lead-contamination-chicago-tap-water-revealed#:~:text=The%20Guardian's%20analysis%20found%20that,of%20Little%20Village%20in%20August">The Guardian</a> revealed that, out of 24,000 tests, 1000 had lead levels exceeding federal standards for tap water of 15 ppb,1/3 exceeded bottled water standards of 5ppb, and 71% exceeded drinking fountain standards of 1ppb.

We have re-engineered and updated The Guardian’s analysis with data on 45k+ home tests from 2016-2024 collected by Chicago Department of Water Management (DWM) on the City of Chicago as a whole and the neighborhood of North Lawndale in particular.
